### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Project title: A Tale of Two Futures: A Comparison of Communist vs. Capitalist Philosophers
+ This project is conducted by Ananya Tinaikar 


+ Project summary: Throughout history, two dominant systems have been at the forefront of philosophical discussions: Capitalism and Communism. These systems have been shaped by the ideas of influential authors, each offering their own unique perspectives on how society should be structured and how wealth should be distributed. The purpose of my exploratory data anaysis is to investigate and compare the text charactersitics, sentence structure, sentiment, and emotional connotations of Capitalist and Communist philosophers in the hopes of revealing trends that are indicative of their ideological attributes.
